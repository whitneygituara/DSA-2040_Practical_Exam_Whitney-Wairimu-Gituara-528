The K-Means clustering algorithm performed strongly on the synthetic Iris-like dataset.
Using k=3, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) was high, showing strong agreement between the 
predicted clusters and the true species labels. This is expected because the synthetic data 
were generated from well-separated Gaussian distributions, making the clusters naturally 
distinct. The scatter plot of petal length versus petal width shows clear groupings with 
minimal overlap, further confirming the quality of clustering.

Experimenting with k=2 and k=4 revealed that both values produce inferior clustering, as 
shown by their lower ARI scores. The elbow curve strongly supports k=3 as the optimal 
choice, where the reduction in SSE begins to taper off. Misclassifications were minimal 
and mostly occurred where cluster boundaries are closer together.

In real-world applications, K-Means clustering is widely used for customer segmentation, 
market analysis, fraud detection, and medical pattern identification. However, the strong 
results here are partly due to the synthetic nature of the data, which is more ideal and 
less noisy than real-world datasets.
